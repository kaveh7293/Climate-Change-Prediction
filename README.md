<h1> project description </h1>
<p>	 In this project, I want to estimate what would be the result of the climate change policies to mitigate the consequences of the increase in the atmosphere average temperature. Based on the information <a> here</a>, carbond dioxide emission is the main reason that the average temperature of the atmosphere increase up to 0.8 C compared to the world intact condition.</p>
